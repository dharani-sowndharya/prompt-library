MODULE 1 - START WRITING PROMPTS LIKE A PRO

- Prompting is the process of providing specific instructions to a Gen AI tool to receive new information or to achieve a desired outcome on a task.

- Multimodal (Text, images, Sound, Videos, code)

- 5 step frame work
1) TASK - What you want the AI to do
Persona - "Act as an expert"
Format - "Organize in table"
2) CONTEXT - The more context, the better output
"Turning 26 yrs old"
3) REFERENCES - Examples 
4) EVALUATE - Check if the result is what I wanted
5) ITERATE - Keep adding things.

- Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs 

- ITERATION METHODS: 
1) Revisit the prompting framework
2) Separate Prompts into shorter sentences
3) Trying different phrasing or switching to an analogous task
4) Introduce Constraints

- Hallucinations & Biases are common problems sometimes. So always be responsible and evaluate your results. 

MODULE 2 -  DESIGN PROMPTS FOR EVERYDAY WORK TASKS

- Have a prompt library. 
- Instead of a generic "Write a summary" be specific "Write a summary in a friendly, easy to understand tone like explaining to a curious friend"

MODULE 3 - SPEED UP DATA ANALYSIS & PRESENTATION BUILDING

- Be careful of the data that you are entering into the Gen AI. 
- It can help in Google sheets for formulas and trends if u include the sheet.
- Build a presentation prompt structure.

MODULE 4 - USE AI AS A CREATOR OR EXPERT PARTNER

- Prompt Chaining: A way of guiding Gen AI tools through a series of interconnected prompts, adding new layers of complexity along the way. example: author trying to market his book using Google AI studio

- 2 ways: 
1) Chain of thought prompting: Ask AI to explain its reasoning in a step-by-step process (explain your thought process)
2) Tree of thought prompting: Allows multiple reasoning paths and branches simultaneously. Helpful for abstract and complex problems. 
Pro-tip: use them combined 

- Meta prompting: Use AI to generate a prompt for you, when you get stuck.

- AI AGENT: An expert designed to help with tasks and answer questions. Ex: coding agent, marketing agent, learning agent, friend etc.

- AGENT SIM: simulation agent. [Interviewer - Job interviews]
- AGENT X: Agent for expert feedback.
