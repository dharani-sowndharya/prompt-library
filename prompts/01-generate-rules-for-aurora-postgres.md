Please write me a rule in markdown to be used by an LLM that tells it to design a Aurora Postgres Provisioned DB following the industry best practices and well architected framework using Terraform. Use the template from the prompt-library/prompt-templates/01-rules-prompt-template.md for the template and give me a rules files.

Can you add this as 01-aurora-postgres-provisioned-rules.md in generated-prompts directory
