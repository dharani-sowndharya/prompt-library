Please generate me a rules file template that I can base my rules files on. I have a similar template for prompts prompt-templates/00-prompt-template.md and would like something similar for my rules files.

The rules template should have a structure that is optimised for an LLM to use as system context, yet also human readable. It should be applicable to a variety of topics such as Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, Testing Strategy, Functional Kotlin etc. Some of these rules will be more technical in nature while others purely philisophical.

The target rules should generally stay short and concise (under 200 lines), so please factor this into your template too

Please close with a TL;DR section at the end of the rules template!

Please follow industy best practices and emerging patterns found on the internet for rules files when formalating this rules template!

Please write the rules template to the prompts-template/ directory as 00-rules-template.md
