## Extra Considerations

*Critical factors requiring special attention during Aurora PostgreSQL implementation.*

- **Security Compliance:** Ensure implementation meets SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA requirements where applicable
- **Network Isolation:** Implement proper VPC security groups with least privilege access principles
- **Cost Optimization:** Right-size instances based on workload requirements and implement Aurora Serverless v2 where appropriate
- **Disaster Recovery:** Plan for cross-region backup strategy and document recovery procedures
- **Connection Management:** Implement connection pooling strategies for high-traffic applications
- **Version Management:** Establish upgrade path and testing procedures for PostgreSQL engine versions
- **Secrets Rotation:** Ensure automatic credential rotation doesn't impact application connectivity
- **Performance Baseline:** Establish performance benchmarks and alerting thresholds before go-live
- **Compliance Logging:** Ensure database activity streams meet audit and compliance requirements
- **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate connection limits based on instance class and application needs

## Testing Considerations

*Comprehensive testing strategy for Aurora PostgreSQL infrastructure validation.*

**Infrastructure Testing:**
- Terraform plan and apply validation with automated testing framework
- Network connectivity testing from application subnets to database subnets
- SSL/TLS connection validation and certificate verification
- Multi-AZ failover testing with simulated primary instance failure

**Security Testing:**
- Penetration testing for database access controls and network security
- Encryption validation for data at rest and in transit
- IAM policy testing for least privilege access
- Secrets Manager integration and rotation testing

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing with realistic database workloads
- Connection pooling efficiency testing
- Performance Insights metric validation
- Backup and restore performance benchmarking

**Compliance Testing:**
- Database activity stream audit log verification
- Access control validation for compliance requirements
- Backup encryption and retention policy verification
- Parameter group security configuration validation

**Quality Gates:**
- 100% Terraform code coverage with automated validation
- Zero critical security findings from security scanning tools
- Successful disaster recovery simulation with RTO/RPO validation
- Performance metrics within established baseline thresholds

## Implementation Notes

*Technical preferences and architectural guidance for Aurora PostgreSQL implementation.*

**Terraform Architecture:**
- Use modular Terraform design with separate modules for networking, security, and database components
- Implement remote state management with S3 backend and DynamoDB locking
- Use Terraform workspaces for environment separation (dev, staging, prod)
- Implement Terraform validation policies using Sentinel or OPA

**Security Implementation:**
- Customer-managed KMS keys with proper key rotation policies
- Security groups with restrictive ingress rules and explicit egress rules
- AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation every 30 days
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions using AWS managed policies where possible

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- CloudWatch dashboards with key performance indicators
- Automated alerting for CPU utilization, connection count, and replication lag
- Performance Insights with detailed query analysis capabilities
- Database activity streams for comprehensive audit logging

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Follow HashiCorp Terraform style guide and naming conventions
- Implement comprehensive variable validation and descriptions
- Use consistent tagging strategy across all resources
- Document all custom parameter group modifications
